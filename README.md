# Storefront API Examples

Shopify's [Storefront API](https://help.shopify.com/api/storefront-api) allows you to build custom ecommerce experiences.

Each directory is a self-contained example application that demonstrates usage of the Storefront API.
The examples are built on both Shopify specific libraries and popular open source frameworks (React, Ember, etc).

See the `README.md` in each example directory for more details and how to get started.
