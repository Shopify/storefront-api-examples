Precise rendering behavior is configured via the `render` prop\n * which takes a callback.\n *\n * The container created using `Relay.createContainer` must be supplied via the\n * `Container` prop, and the query configuration that conforms to the shape of a\n * `RelayQueryConfig` must be supplied via the `queryConfig` prop.\n *\n * === Render Callback ===\n *\n * The `render` callback is called with an object with the following properties:\n *\n *   props: ?{[propName: string]: mixed}\n *     If present, sufficient data is ready to render the container. This object\n *     must be spread into the container using the spread attribute operator. If\n *     absent, there is insufficient data to render the container.\n *\n *   done: boolean\n *     Whether all data dependencies have been fulfilled. If `props` is present\n *     but `done` is false, then sufficient data is ready to render, but some\n *     data dependencies have not yet been fulfilled.\n *\n *   error: ?Error\n *     If present, an error occurred while fulfilling data dependencies. If\n *     `props` and `error` are both present, then sufficient data is ready to\n *     render, but an error occurred while fulfilling deferred dependencies.\n *\n *   retry: ?Function\n *     A function that can be called to re-attempt to fulfill data dependencies.\n *     This property is only present if an `error` has occurred.\n *\n *   stale: boolean\n *     When `forceFetch` is enabled, a request is always made to fetch updated\n *     data. However, if all data dependencies can be immediately fulfilled, the\n *     `props` property will be present. In this case, `stale` will be true.\n *\n * The `render` callback can return `undefined` to continue rendering the last\n * view rendered (e.g. when transitioning from one `queryConfig` to another).\n *\n * If a `render` callback is not supplied, the default behavior is to render the\n * container if data is available, the existing view if one exists, or nothing.\n *\n * === Refs ===\n *\n * References to elements rendered by the `render` callback can be obtained by\n * using the React `ref` prop. For example:\n *\n *   <FooComponent {...props} ref={handleFooRef} />\n *\n *   function handleFooRef(component) {\n *     // Invoked when `<FooComponent>` is mounted or unmounted. When mounted,\n *     // `component` will be the component. When unmounted, `component` will\n *     // be null.\n *   }\n *\n */\n\nvar RelayRenderer = function (_React$Component) {\n  (0, _inherits3['default'])(RelayRenderer, _React$Component);\n\n  function RelayRenderer(props, context) {\n    (0, _classCallCheck3['default'])(this, RelayRenderer);\n\n    var _this = (0, _possibleConstructorReturn3['default'])(this, _React$Component.call(this, props, context));\n\n    var garbageCollector = _this.props.environment.getStoreData().getGarbageCollector();\n    _this.gcHold = garbageCollector && garbageCollector.acquireHold();\n    _this.mounted = true;\n    _this.pendingRequest = null;\n    _this.state = {\n      active: false,\n      readyState: null,\n      retry: _this._retry.bind(_this)\n    };\n    return _this;\n  }\n\n  RelayRenderer.prototype.componentDidMount = function componentDidMount() {\n    this._runQueries(this.props);\n  };\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   */\n\n\n  RelayRenderer.prototype._runQueries = function _runQueries(_ref) {\n    var _this2 = this;\n\n    var Container = _ref.Container;\n    var forceFetch = _ref.forceFetch;\n    var onForceFetch = _ref.onForceFetch;\n    var onPrimeCache = _ref.onPrimeCache;\n    var queryConfig = _ref.queryConfig;\n    var environment = _ref.environment;\n\n    var onReadyStateChange = function onReadyStateChange(readyState) {\n      if (!_this2.mounted) {\n        _this2._handleReadyStateChange((0, _extends3['default'])({}, readyState, { mounted: false }));\n        return;\n      }\n      if (request !== _this2.lastRequest) {\n        // Ignore (abort) ready state if we have a new pending request.\n        return;\n      }\n      if (readyState.aborted || readyState.done || readyState.error) {\n        _this2.pendingRequest = null;\n      }\n      _this2.setState({\n        active: true,\n        readyState: (0, _extends3['default'])({}, readyState, {\n          mounted: true\n        })\n      });\n    };\n\n    if (this.pendingRequest) {\n      this.pendingRequest.abort();\n    }\n\n    var querySet = require('./getRelayQueries')(Container, queryConfig);\n    var request = this.pendingRequest = forceFetch ?
