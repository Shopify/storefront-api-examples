# Storefront API Examples

Shopify's [Storefront API](https://help.shopify.com/api/storefront-api) allows you to build custom ecommerce experiences.

Each directory is a self-contained example application that demonstrates usage of the Storefront API.
The examples are built on both Shopify specific libraries and popular open source frameworks (React, Ember, etc). These examples are built and maintained by community members. As such, it's up to you as a developer to use the [Storefront API reference](https://help.shopify.com/en/api/storefront-api/reference) or check the API version [release notes](https://help.shopify.com/en/api/versioning/release-notes) to ensure that you are using the most up-to-date fields.

See the `README.md` in each example directory for more details and how to get started.
